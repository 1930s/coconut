# Coconut

Coconut is a **simple, elegant, Pythonic functional programming language** that compiles to [Python](https://www.python.org/). Since **all valid Python is valid Coconut**, joining the [over 30,000 people](http://pypi-ranking.info/module/coconut) already using Coconut will only extend and enhance what you're already capable of in Python.

Why use Coconut? Coconut is built to be fundamentally **useful**. Coconut enhances the repetoire of Python programmers to include the tools of modern functional programming, in such a way that those tools are **easy** to use and immensly **powerful**; that is, **Coconut does to functional programming what Python did to imperative programming**. And Coconut code runs the same on **any Python version**, making the Python 2/3 split a thing of the past.

Specifically, Coconut adds to Python **built-in, syntactical support** for:
- pattern-matching
- algebraic data types
- destructuring assignment
- partial application
- lazy lists
- function composition
- prettier lambdas
- infix notation
- pipeline-style programming
- operator functions
- tail recursion optimization
- parallel programming

and much more!

Installing Coconut is as easy as

1. installing [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
2. opening a command-line prompt,
3. and entering:

<div class="code-block">python -m pip install coconut</div>

which will give you access to all the features of the Coconut command-line utility, including
- **compiling** single Coconut files or entire Coconut projects,
- **interpreting** Coconut code on-the-fly, and
- hooking into existing Python applications like **IPython / Jupyter**.
